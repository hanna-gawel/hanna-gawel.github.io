<h3>Deadline 2/15/2022</h3>
<p class="justify-text"><b>overview</b> PI Andrew White at University of Rochester Chemical
    Engineering is looking
    for a
    postdoctoral researcher to contribute to a multi-year NIH-funded project on "Learning to learn in
    structural biology with deep neural networks."</p>
<p class="justify-text"><b>what you'll do</b> We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who
    is an expert in
    molecular simulation, deep learning in chemistry, or computational structural biology. Under
    mentorship, you will develop and apply deep learning methods to molecular simulation and
    modeling of proteins and protein-protein interactions. Expertise in deep learning is not
    required, though is a strength. This is a multi-year project with a long-term goal towards
    advancing ML and AI methods for deep learning and meta-learning in structural biology. These
    methods reduce the amount of data necessary to apply supervised learning to applications where
    there are only tens to hundreds of data points. Examples include developing peptide drugs,
    antibody design, multifunctional biomaterials, and resolving intrinsically disordered protein
    conformations. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will mentor graduate students, lead independent
    projects, and collaborate in research planning. You can find examples of our recent work on our
    publications page. You will work with an interdisciplinary team with backgrounds in computer
    science,
    molecular simulation, and biochemistry. </p>
<p class="justify-text"><b>requirements</b> Candidates should have a PhD degree in chemical
    engineering, chemistry, physics, computer science or related area. You should have multiple
    peer-reviewed publications in addition to a PhD. You should have demonstrated expertise in
    statistical mechanics. Expertise in biochemistry and/or deep learning is a
    strength. Candidate should have experience in scientific software best-practices, including
    version control, testing, and software collaboration. A GitHub account or similar project
    portfolio is required. </p>
<p class="justify-text"><b>details</b> This position is open immediately. Starting date is negotiable, and
    candidates will be evaluated
    until the position is filled. The initial appointment will be 1 year and is renewable. Salary is
    set by NIH guidelines on postdoctoral research salary. All nationalities are welcome to apply
    and will be considered. Minority and women candidates are especially encouraged to apply. To
    apply, please send an email to <a href="mailto:andrew.white@rochester.edu">Andrew White</a> with
    the subject "Postdoc Search 2022" and describe your interest in the position and attach (1)
    curriculum vitae, (2) an example
    of a recent publication authored by you and (3) an example of a scientific software, preferably
    your GitHub username.</p>
