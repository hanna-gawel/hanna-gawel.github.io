# Some Simple Dava Visualization Tips

I'm not a designer or an expert on visualizations, but I've learned a lot over the years about making readable plots with reasonably appealing aesthetics. My advisor, David Mimno, and my committee member, Jeff Rzeszotarski, have both taught me a lot about data visualizations, and I've picked up tips from other researchers, data scientists, and authors.

## Steal Like an Artist

Python plotting website, other papers

## Minimalism is Good... Clarity is Better

Edward Tufte emphasizes minimalism in his books and lectures. Remove grid lines! Remove shadows! Anything that isn't strictly necessary - remove it!

I think this advice is excellent... to a point. I also prefer minimal plots, with white or transparent backgrounds, few gridlines, solid colors, etc. However, sometimes gridlines can help you make your point.

## All About Colors

Colorbrewer, website to find lighter/darker colors, color blindness, different types of palettes

## In Presentations

When reviewing my presentations, David has always told me, "Images cost $1, words cost $5, and equations cost $10." Meaning, rely on images much more than text or math. You can include other elements, but you need very good reasons for doing so.

## In Papers

Save your images as PDFs so that you don't lose detail when zooming in.
