## About

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="me.png"> -->

Iâ€™m an information manager and PhD Candidate research how society is conscious about information about air quality in urban space. My expertise includes project design and management, data analysis and interpretation, and the development and implementation of research tools. 

I enjoy generating new concepts and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My colleagues would describe me as a motivated, resourceful individual who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when faced with adversity. 


**I'll be on the job market starting in Fall 2023.** Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for your academic department or industry research group.
